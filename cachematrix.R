## Catching the inverse of the matrix


## This function creates a special matrix that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special matrix and returns the makeCacheMatrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
